# About me

My major is statistics and information mathematics.
In particular, I am working on data assimilation with uncertainty involving unknown models. 
By considering tractable data transformation using kernel methods or Koopman operators, I aim to derive appropriate state estimation schemes combined with machine learning theoretically.
